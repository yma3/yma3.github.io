It's been a while but I finally managed to finish my site! Thanks to a lot of help from my friends, especially Alec Huang who gave me a couple of nice lectures on HTML/CSS/JS. Check out his own site at [teamnex.us](http://teamnex.us/).

I wanted to make a place that could act as both a portfolio for all of my projects, as well as a medium for me to introduce small but interesting tidbits that I've learned. Some of the smaller projects will probably be posted here, but for the most part, it's a site dedicated to my journey to learn. Despite studying mechanical engineering, I chose to pursue data science. I'll be documenting my journey here.

This site was made using [minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and it's hosted on my github. Any assets are either taken online from their direct sources, or created by me.
