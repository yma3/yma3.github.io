I'm a graduate from the Cooper Union in New York City with a Bachelors of Engineering and Masters of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering. Funny how I want to work in data science.

I've been interested in feedback control systems and data-driven decision making and have only recently managed to articulate that interest in the projects on this website. I love everything related to tech from software to hardware, from the earth to the stars.

There's a lot to do and I've made it a personal goal to learn as much as I can.

Check out my [TEDxCooperUnion talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1797la1wSws) where I talk about the stuff I learned during my time at [Invention Factory](https://inventionfactory.org/inventions/spill-resistant-disposable-cup).

My hobbies include gaming ([VALORANT](https://playvalorant.com/en-gb/), and [Path of Exile](https://www.pathofexile.com/)), reading [xianxia](https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal) novels or other [sci-fi](https://www.amazon.com/Three-Body-Problem-Cixin-Liu/dp/0765382032)/[fantasy](https://www.amazon.com/Promise-Blood-Powder-Mage-Book-ebook/dp/B0092XHPIG/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=promise+of+powder&qid=1609189835&s=books&sr=1-1) genres, and listening to some of my favorite artists.
